- Please use custom settings, and choose "Cross site tracking cookies". The default is the second topion which overdones protection.

# How to install:
- As this extension is not signed by firefox, you will need to use it as a temporary add-on. Head towards [this page](about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox) (Raw link: `about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox`) and click on "Load Temporary Add-on". Select the zip file you downloaded from `build/` and there you go!
